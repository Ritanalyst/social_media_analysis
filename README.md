Social Media Usage and User Behavior Analysis

Description
This project analyzes social media usage in relation to various demographic factors such as age, occupation, time spent on social media, and other related activities. The data visualization was created using Power BI, with the aim of better understanding user behaviors and how they vary across different age groups and occupations.

The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle: "Social Media Usage and User Behavior". After downloading the dataset, data cleaning was performed using Microsoft Excel to prepare the data for analysis.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

Age group: Age group of the user

Occupation: User's occupation

Hours spent only per day: Number of hours spent on social media each day

Use of social media: Frequency of social media use (e.g., never, rarely, etc.)

Paid support for content creators: Paid support for content creators (e.g., yes/no)

Social media platforms regularly used: Social media platforms regularly used

Internet primarily use: Primary use of the internet

Most engaged activity: Most engaged activity

Most used social media platform: Most used social media platform

Device most used: Most used device for accessing social media

Data Cleaning
During the data cleaning process, the following steps were performed:

Removal of missing values: Missing values were identified and addressed. Incomplete data was either excluded or replaced with appropriate values when possible.

Data normalization: Categorical variables, such as "Use of social media," were transformed into numerical values to allow for more in-depth analysis.

Duplicate removal: Duplicate records in the dataset were removed.

Format corrections: Some columns were corrected to standardize the format (e.g., conversion of dates and hours into a uniform format).

Tools Used
Microsoft Excel for data cleaning.

Power BI for creating interactive visualizations.

These visualizations allow users to observe trends in social media usage across different user categories and explore online consumption behaviors.
